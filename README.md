## Info

I wanted to have a personal website to showcase my Python's Django Skills, so I decided to learn enough about Front End and Deployment to make it.

I made it from scratch, with no libraries or frameworks whatsoever, because I think the most important thing to learn first is basics. I will have enough time in the future to learn React, Redux etc

I also learnt about Web design, Colors, and Layouts so that I could a make a good looking and also easy to see portfolio, that represented the way I am.
      


              
## Technologies

For this project, I used **Html**, **Css** and **Javascript**, with no libraries or frameworks. Also some **Web Design** skills.         
I also learn how to buy a **Domain**, add as **SSL** Certificate and link it to my deployment site.                
I deployed it on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), with its new app service, so that I could host there an static app for free for as long as I wanted.          
As you can see, ALL the code is in one single .html file.
               
               
                 
## Motivation

I had a blast making my website and I feel very proud about it.                  
It was the first time making a big project from scratch, following no course or tutorial.
